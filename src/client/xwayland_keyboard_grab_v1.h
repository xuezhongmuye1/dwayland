/**
 * @short Wrapper for the zwp_xwayland_keyboard_grab_manager_v1 interface.
 *
 * This class provides a convenient wrapper for the zwp_xwayland_keyboard_grab_manager_v1 interface.
 * Its main purpose is to hold the information about one ZWPXwaylandKeyboardGrabManagerV1.
 *
 * To use this class one needs to interact with the Registry. There are two
 * possible ways to create an ZWPXwaylandKeyboardGrabManagerV1 interface:
 * @code
 * ZWPXwaylandKeyboardGrabManagerV1 *c = registry->createDDESeat(name, version);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This creates the ZWPXwaylandKeyboardGrabManagerV1 and sets it up directly. As an alternative this
 * can also be done in a more low level way:
 * @code
 * ZWPXwaylandKeyboardGrabManagerV1 *c = new ZWPXwaylandKeyboardGrabManagerV1;
 * c->setup(registry->bindDDESeat(name, version));
 * @endcode
 *
 * The ZWPXwaylandKeyboardGrabManagerV1 can be used as a drop-in replacement for any zwp_xwayland_keyboard_grab_manager_v1
 * pointer as it provides matching cast operators.
 *
 * Please note that all properties of ZWPXwaylandKeyboardGrabManagerV1 are not valid until the
 * changed signal has been emitted. The wayland server is pushing the
 * information in an async way to the ZWPXwaylandKeyboardGrabManagerV1 instance. By emitting changed
 * the ZWPXwaylandKeyboardGrabManagerV1 indicates that all relevant information is available.
 *
 * @see Registry
 * @since 5.5
